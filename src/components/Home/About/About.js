                        <b>Technopreneur</b> is the flagship event of IEDC MEC, and one of the most looked forward to events
                    in MEC. It is the annual entrepreneurial and managerial symposium of Model Engineering College
                    and includes a plethora of events including Idea Pitching, Prototype Development, hackathons,
                    and much more. The first edition of Technopreneur, Technopreneur 2006, went on to win the Best
                    Yi-Net event at the CII National Summit in Mumbai. Technopreneur 2021 will embrace its past
                    legacy with a modern upgrade and intends to train and up-skill the hungry minds seeking to
                    build enterprises on their own. With over 1000+ participants from top engineering colleges and
                    B-schools across the country, Technopreneur aims to impact everyone from students to working-class
                    professionals. One of our most exciting pre-events for this year is the Hult Prize, which is an annual,
                    year-long competition that challenges students to solve pressing social issues around the world.
                    <br /> <br />
                        <b>Emerge! Endure! Evolve! </b>
                        <br /> <br />
                    Technopreneur has always followed the path of these three words when it comes to choosing a
                    theme. In this pandemic-stricken world, each human being is fighting through thick and thin to
                    overcome the challenges we are faced with. To successfully emerge from the ashes of these dire
                    conditions, this year's theme for Technopreneur is to evolve into a better world through disruption,
                    to provide the most innovative solutions for our problems. Our theme hopes to invoke a sense of
                    responsibility and leadership in one's mind in order for them to understand that all our battles can
                    be won through entrepreneurial solutions. Technopreneur is that missing puzzle piece for aspiring minds
                    to make their ideas and dreams come true.
